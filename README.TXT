Game is VERY slow in vb, please compile it!!!!

In order to pass to the next level, you must collect all the green
diamons, and then go to "level" sign, where you will be transfered to
the next level.

Please report any bugs, or fix them!

Contact me if you want to make game levels. If you can draw some more
enemies, draw some more maps, more textures, then you can make the
game better :), email me if you want some more informations on game
creation, editors, etc.

You might need to change the game speed, open the "config.som"
file and there you will see this: "15".

o For slow computers (100-600mhz): Change it between "1" and "15" to improve
  the game speed, choose the speed you want.

o For fast computers(600-mhz): Change it between "15" and "40" to slow it down.

But you should keep 15, change it only if it is VERY fast/slow!!
