### Description

Very nice 2d arcade side-scrooling directx7 game, there are sounds, music, nice graphics, 4 levels, bunch of monsters, all that 2d game must have. If you like Super Mario, then you WILL like this game. I wrote it a year ago, and dont have time to add more levels (there are 4 only, about 30 minutes to play).

Please vote if you liked it.
